# ML-codsoft
It consists of the internship projects that have been done in the guidance of CodSoft.
There are three projects:
1) credit card fraud detection model that tells us whether the transaction is legitimate or not
2) customer churn prediction that predicts customer churn for a subscription-based service or business
3) spam sms detection AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
